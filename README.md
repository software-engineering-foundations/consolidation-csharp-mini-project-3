# Mini-Project 3: Calculator

## Introduction

You are building a command-line calculator.

You have decided to write your own `calculate` function.

## Setup

Start by running `dotnet restore`. To run the calculator, simply use `dotnet run --project Calculator`. To run the tests, use `dotnet test`.

## Grading

Each of the 100 tests is worth 1 point, meaning that an overall grade of 100 can be achieved by passing all tests.

Any situation which would result in complex arithmetic, such as fractional powers of negative numbers, is not required to be handled, although you may do so if you wish.
